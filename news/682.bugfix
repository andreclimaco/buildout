Patch the ``find`` method from ``pkg_resources.WorkingSet``.
Let this use the code from ``setuptools`` 75.8.2, if the currently used version is older.
This is better at finding installed distributions.
But don't patch ``setuptools`` versions older than 61: the new version of the method would give an error there.
