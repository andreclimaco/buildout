Require ``setuptools >= 49.0.0``.
This is the first version that supports PEP 496 environment markers, for example ``demo ==0.1; python_version < '3.9'``.
An earlier change had ``setuptools >= 42.0.2``, otherwise we got ImportErrors.
Also, since this is higher than 38.2.3, we are sure to have support for wheels.
Remove support for ``distribute``, which was probably already broken.
